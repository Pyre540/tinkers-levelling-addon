# Tinkers' Levelling Addon
[![curseforge](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@2/assets/compact/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-levelling-addon)

Simple, **unofficial** addon mod for [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) for modern Minecraft versions. Based on the [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling) addon for Minecraft 1.12.2.

This addon adds a single new modifier for Tinkers' tools and armors - _Improvable_. Unlike original addon, tool levelling is not available from the start and must be applied to each piece of gear separately. After applying your tools are able to earn XP and level up. XP is earned by performing tool's intended actions like mining, harvesting, dealing damage, etc. On level up additional modifier slot and/or stat is rewarded.

**Disclaimer:** Since Tinkers' Construct is based around limited amount of modifier slots and stats, this addon completely disrupts its balance!

This is an **unofficial** addon. Please do **not** reach out to the Tinkers' Construct developers for support and be sure to mention that this mod is installed if you do have an issue with Tinkers' Construct itself. You can report bugs and crashes related to Tinkers' Levelling Addon [here](https://github.com/Pyre540/tinkers-levelling-addon/issues).

## Features

- Earn tool XP by performing actions with your tools (mining, harvesting, shearing, attacking)
- Earn armor XP by taking damage or using Thorns modifier
- Gain 1 free modifier and/or stat per level up
- Customize the order of modifier slot and/or stat types gained after each level up (or set it to random)
- Set maximum level (or make it unlimited)
- Adjust level requirements and experience sources
- Customize level up sound and messages

## Getting started

To get started simply apply _Improvable_ modifier to your tool/armor piece. As it's designed to be an endgame modifier, the default recipe is pricey (1x Nether Star, 4x Bottle o' Enchanting) and requires Tinker's Anvil and 1 ability slot (This recipe can be easily changed by simple datapack - [example](https://github.com/Pyre540/tinkers-levelling-addon/tree/1.16/examples/datapacks/override_improvable_recipe_1.16.5)).

After that your tool is ready to earn some XP, so go and mine some stuff, cut some trees and kill some mobs!
